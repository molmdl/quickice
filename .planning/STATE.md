### Blockers

**User-identified issues (from 35-01 checkpoint):**
- Missing function found during verification
- Documentation may need redo
- User suggests considering adding a phase before continuing with docs

**Recommendation:** Investigate missing function issue before proceeding with documentation-heavy phases (35-02 to 35-06)
